# TheLingo

This is an experimental language trying not to assume

TheLingo don't assume:

+ Numbers are basic
+ Docs and codes are mainly written in English
+ Time can be represented in unsigned 64-bit integer
+ Users are all on one planet, and the network delay won't exceed 24h
+ Internet exist
+ Users only use Windows, UNIX-like OS and/or realtime OS based on C
+ Users only have electronic computers and quantum computers, no other types of computers
+ More

TheLingo assume for now:

+ Lisp's symbols are natural to identify things

## Implementation

1. Implement the core language in a language for electronic computers
1. Implement some experimental languages in the core language

## Status

I rewrote the core language hundreds of times and I am still rewriting it.
